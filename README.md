# Code-wolfram-water-table-models-
The provided Wolfram Language code constitutes a comprehensive framework for the generation of water table PDFs under two modeling scenarios (with and without salinity effects) and using two solution methods (analytical and numerical). By utilizing case-specific input data from three Everglades case studies and one hypothetical site, the code facilitates a detailed comparative analysis. The generated PDF files can be used for further documentation or presentation purposes.  This implementation can be adapted or extended based on more complex governing equations or additional environmental parameters as required by future studies.
