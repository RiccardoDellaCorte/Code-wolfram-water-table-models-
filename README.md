# Code-wolfram-water-table-models-
This repository contains Wolfram code used for the creation of Water Table PDF simulations, incorporating both saline and non-saline scenarios. The models utilize both numerical and analytical solutions. The input data includes three case studies from the Everglades (Florida) as well as a hypothetical site within the same region.

In the saline case, three distinct species from the Birdfoot area, each with varying levels of salinity tolerance, have been considered to examine the effect of salinity on the water table dynamics.
